# Image interpolation with auto-encoder.

Real world data is noisy. Noise can come in the form of incorrect or missing values. This code is supplementary to an article [1], describing a way of filling missing values with auto-encoders. An auto-encoder is trained on noisy data with no reference values available for missing entries. The procedure is explained on the task of image reconstruction.
